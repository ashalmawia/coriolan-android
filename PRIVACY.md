# Coriolan: Privacy policy

Thank you for using Coriolan for Android and for your interest in your privacy. <br>

My name is **ashalmawia** üëã, I am a fun lady who loves studying languages but is bored by learning new words. <br>
I also happen to be a software developer, so I created Coriolan - an app to make remembering words more fun for me. <br>
I believe that education should be available to everyone, so I am sharing my app with the world for free.  <br>

Coriolan is an open source application, you can find its code 
[on GitHub](https://github.com/ashalmawia/coriolan-android). <br>
The app is officially distributed for free via Google Play.

**Here are the kinds of data that Coriolan operates with:**

| Kind of data                                                                                                                           | Purpose                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| - user-generated content (words, translations, usage examples, decks etc.)<br/>- data about the learning process (status of the cards) | to assist with learning the words                |  
| - statistical data (e.g. how many cards where learned in a day)                                                                        | to reflect the progress to the user and motivate |
| - diagnostic data (e.g. crash stacktraces)                                                                                             | to keep the app healthy and reliable             |

### Storing user-generated data

This app is fully offline. All the data user provide to it is stored on the user's device. <br>
It is not synced to any kind of online storage. Thus, the user has full control over it.

_This might change in the future, but will always remain optional and under user's control._

### Exporting data

Coriolan can export user-generated data (such as exproted decks or backups). <br> 
This is optional and the user has full control over when and where
it is exported and stored.

### Person-identifiable information

This app **does not collect nor store** any person-identifiable information. <br>
_This might change in the future but will always be optional and under user's control._

### Diagnostic data

This _app collects depersonalized debug information_, such as crash stacktraces,
that helps me to keep Coriolan working reliably. <br>
This data is shared with the industry-standard Firebase services in 
depersonalized manner.

### Ads

This app is ads-free. _This might change in the future but I hope it won't, I don't like ads._

### Contact information
